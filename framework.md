# FrameWork 

## BootStrap :Read the [documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/), play and experiment with the samples, get the basics right, and enjoy creating new and beautiful designs.

### Common mistakes
* Basic misconceptions about the framework: Bootstrap comes bundled with basic HTML and CSS design templates
that include many common UI components. These include Typography, Tables, Forms, Buttons, Glyphicons, Dropdowns, Buttons
and Input Groups, Navigation, Pagination, Labels and Badges, Alerts, Progress Bars, Modals, Tabs, Accordions, Carousels, 
and many more. You can choose and pick a few of them,
and with its default configuration quickly generate a UI that handles multiple browsers, devices, and resolutions with nice format.

* Do not modify the bootstrap.css file. Use the Bootstrap LESS source code. 

* You don’t have to use every feature of Bootstrap.

* It is important to state that all Bootstrap plugins can be used purely through the markup API, without writing a single 
line of JavaScript. This is Bootstrap’s first-class API and should be your first consideration when using plugins. 

* Bootlint, an HTML linting tool for Bootstrap projects. 

* Hover effect is not for mobile phone -- There is only touch. 

## CSS Tips 
* [Box Model](https://css-tricks.com/box-sizing/) Those wishes were granted when the box-sizing property was introduced in CSS3.
Though box-sizing has three possible values (content-box, padding-box, and border-box), the most popular value is border-box.we can change the box
model to what was once the "quirky" way, where an element's specified width and height aren't affected by padding or borders. Very useful tecniques.

## CSS grid layout 

## SCSS file  -- where it provide variable and math support.
